## Prerequisites

**Before you begin, do this:**

- Install the latest (recommended) version of [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Create a MongoDB account.
- Clone the repository to your computer


**To Start the Frontend Do this**

1. Navigate to the client directory (this is the frontend folder)

2. Install the required npm packages through the terminal. 
    - Run the command **npm install**
    - Most likely you will need other packages as well when you start the development host in step 3 if there is an error install the packages that is shown in the browser's error list


3. Run the enviornment by using the command **npm start** 


**To Start the Backend Do this**

1. Navigate to the server directory (this is the backend folder)

2. Install the required packages for the backend
    - Run the command **npm install express**
    - Again you may need other packages as well when you start the server in step 3 if there is an error install the packages that is shown in the browser's  error

3. Start the backend server by running the command **node server.js**
    - It is okay to run the backend in main if you are making frontend changes that need the backend to run. However, if you are working on the backend code make sure to work in a separate branch then main.
