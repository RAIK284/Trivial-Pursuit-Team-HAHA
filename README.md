## How to Start the Development Environment

**To Start the Frontend:**

1. Open the terminal and navigate into the client directory

2. Install the required npm packages through the terminal. 
    - Run the command **npm install**
    - Most likely you will need other packages as well when you start the development host in step 3 if there is an error install the packages that is shown in the browser's  error
        

3. Run the enviornment by using the command **npm start** 
    - Make sure to not be checked out in the main branch while making Frontend Changes create a branch forked from main and make changes there


**To Start the Backend:**

1. Open the terminal and navigate into the server directory

2. Install the required packages for the backend
    - Run the command **npm install express**
    - Again you may need other packages as well when you start the server in step 3 if there is an error install the packages that is shown in the browser's  error

3. Start the backend server by running the command **node server.js**
    - It is okay to run the backend in main if you are making frontend changes that need the backend to run. However, if you are working on the backend code make sure to work in a separate branch then main.
